# Event Management Website

This is a simple event management website where users can view upcoming events. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

## Getting Started

To run the website locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository through the link
2. Open the project directory in your code editor.
3. Open index.html in your web browser to view the website.

Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

index.html: Main HTML file for the homepage, also contaning Bootstrap CSS and JS code
style.css: CSS file for styling the website.

Design and Development Process

The website was designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind. The main focus was on creating a clean and intuitive user interface. Bootstrap was used to ensure responsiveness and compatibility across devices.

Unique Approaches or Methodologies
Responsive Design: Bootstrap's grid system was used to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
CSS Customization: Custom CSS was used to enhance the default Bootstrap styles and add unique design elements.
Known Issues

Currently, users cannot register for events or view detailed event information. These features will be implemented in future updates.
Next Steps

Level 2:
Develop event detail pages with information about the location, time, and ticket availability.
Implement event registration functionality for users to book seats.
Level 3:
Add user account management system for login, viewing, and managing bookings.
Integrate with external calendar services (e.g., Google Calendar) to automatically add registered events to the user's calendar.
Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions or improvements, please open an issue or create a pull request.
P.S. To complete levels 2 and 3, you will need to add the corresponding functionality using JavaScript to interact with the backend (for example, using AJAX requests) and Django to create an API and manage user accounts. I am sorry, I did not have enough time to complete cause of my finals at university as I am on the exchange right now, and the final week was the one when the 2nd tour sent to me((
